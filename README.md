## Hiya, welcome to Dahlia's source code!

[_Dahlia_](https://crystalgameworks.itch.io/dahlia) was a short visual novel I made in under 36 hours for Velox Formido, a shortform visual novel game jam.
I made this game solo, making the artwork, writing, programming, etc. by myself. The background images are stock photos from Unsplash I edited while the BGM is by Beemyu (not included).

Because this jam was so short, I wanted to share my source code to give others an example of how to make shorter games with good production values (if I do say so myself, haha). Most of the techniques I used in Dahlia were things I learned from making my other games. This is not a perfect example of making a Ren'Py game as this was for a very tight deadline, but I hope it'll help inform you on new ideas and implementations.

There's several things like transforms and color tints and compositions here, feel free to copy the code to use in your own visual novels. **You are not allowed to redistribute this visual novel, however.**

You can play Dahlia yourself [on itch.io](https://crystalgameworks.itch.io/dahlia) and [read the postmortem](https://crystalgameworks.com/dahlia-postmortem/) about my design choices.
